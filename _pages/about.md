Welcome to my website!

I'm Ge Zhang, and 张哿(my last name means joy and grace).I'm a first-year master student in University of Michigan, ECE department.

During past years I spent some time on computer vision/graphics, and recently I'm trying to combine my previous research with robotics.

I play basketball, lift weight, and listen rock n' roll. I also likes arts in most forms but I understand little about it.

Here are some of my favorite bands(and singers): Queens, Zed Zepplin, 福禄寿，郑钧, 崔健, 后海大鲨鱼, GALA...

<!-- I'm a senior undergraduate in ShanghaiTech University, majored in Computer Science. I'm expected to graduate in June 2021, and I'm seeking for PhD positions.

My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Robotics.

The website is still under construction. -->
