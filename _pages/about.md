Welcome to my website!

I'm 张哿(my last name means joy and grace). I'm a first-year master student in University of Michigan, ECE department.

During past years I spent some time on computer vision/graphics, and recently I'm trying to combine my previous research with robotics.

I play basketball, lift weight, and listen rock n' roll. I also likes arts in most forms but I understand little about it.

Here are some of my favorite bands(and singers): Queens, Zed Zepplin, 福禄寿，郑钧, 崔健, 后海大鲨鱼, GALA...
