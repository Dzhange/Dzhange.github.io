I'm a senior undergraduate in ShanghaiTech University, majored in Computer Science. I'm expected to graduate in June 2021, and I'm open for PhD positions.

My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Machine Learning. I'm particularly interested in 3D vision and computational geomotries.
