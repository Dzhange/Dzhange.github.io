## Welcome to my cave!

I'm 张哿(In chinese 哿 means joy in a subtle way). I'm a second-year master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Computer Vision at University of Michigan. I finished my undergrad at ShanghaiTech University. I've also spent some time researching at Stanford University.

The goal of my research is to build a happier world with intelligent machines. During the past years I worked on computer vision&graphics, and since last year I've been working on designing perception algorithm for robots.

I love rock climbing, playing drums, and all forms of visual arts.

It's nice to meet you!
