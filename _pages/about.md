## Welcome to my cave!

I'm Ge Zhang (张哿 in chinese, where 哿 means joy in a subtle way). I'm a Software Engineer at Righthand Robotics with a focus on Computer Vision and Machine Learning, before that I was a master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Computer Vision at University of Michigan. I finished my undergrad at ShanghaiTech University. I've also spent some time researching at Stanford University.

The goal of my work is to build a better world with intelligent machines. During the past years I worked on computer vision&graphics, and recently on designing perception algorithm for robots.

I love rock climbing, playing drums, and all forms of visual arts.

It's nice to meet you!
