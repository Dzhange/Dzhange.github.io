## Welcome to my home!

I'm 张哿(In chinese 哿 means joy and grace). I'm a first-year master student in University of Michigan, ECE department.

My dream and the purpose of my research is to make everyone stronger, smarter and finally happier with intelligent machines.

During the past years I worked on computer vision&graphics, and recently I'm trying to combine my research with robotics.

I play basketball, lift weight, and listen rock n' roll. I also like arts in most forms but understand little about it.

Here are some of my favorite bands(and singers): Queen, Led Zepplin, 郑钧, 后海大鲨鱼...
